# Image_Gallery

Achievements
•	I achieved using the keyboard tab to access the contents of the webpage using the ‘tabIndex’ and the focus property.
•	Using a function to display the title text of each image in the image array when they are clicked.
•	Using the back-and-forth button to toggle between images in the image array
•	Display image title text with the click of a button

Difficulties:
•	Using the ARIA accessibility features
•	Using the image ‘srcset’ feature to make a webpage responsive. Although, I did it, however, I cannot say if I did it right or not. 
•	It was very challenging to use a conditional statement to make the toggle button to navigate the images in the array. 
•	Using arrow keys to navigate through the images

Useful resources
•	MDN Docs
•	W3school

Errors encountered in completing the assignment.
•	Variable scoping 
•	Positioning of elements on the page
